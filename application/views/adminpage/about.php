     <b><h3>Hello !</h3></b><p>I'm a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Information System . I graduated on May 9, 2017. I've been a freelance programmer since 2nd year college but unfortunately we can't get a lot of clients to create a project. In addition to this I am also a PC Technician since 2014, I build a lot of computers from my clients for their personal use, in offices and computer shops or pisonet. Lastly i become a freelance Photographer since 2016 because sometimes capturing different moment makes me happy.</p>
